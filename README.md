# Current Tools, Apps and Services I'm Currently Using and Probably Recommend (2014)

*I completely stole this idea from @sammcj.*

## Android - Non-Games
* <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">CyanogenMod (CM11)</a> - The build for the Galaxy S3 has been surprisingly flawless, so far. Previous third-party ROMs have introduced issues with the camera and GPS, for me. Not so, this time around.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&hl=en">Nova Launcher</a> - Someone recommended this a while back, and I never looked back. It's the first thing that goes on my devices.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alensw.PicFolder&hl=en">QuickPic</a> - A quite decent, free photo gallery app. Especially important now that Android 5 forces the use of the awful Google Plus gallery.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.almalence.opencam&hl=en">A Better Camera</a> - The stock Galaxy S3 camera has a terrific HDR mode. A Better Camera's HDR and DRO modes are excellent replacements, if sometimes buggy.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&hl=en">Google Keep</a> - Finally, a great cloud note taking tool. Lists, text, memos, etc. Grab the excellent <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-notes-and-lis/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki?hl=en">Chrome app</a>, too,  for maximum utility.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digipom.easyvoicerecorder.pro&hl=en">Easy Voice Recorder Pro</a> - Record discreetly to MP3 with various options. Best I've used. Just received a major UI update.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.nickfines.RealCalcPlus&hl=en">RealCalc Plus</a> - My favorite scientific calculator. Also available in a free version. 
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=reddit.news&hl=en">Reddit News Pro</a> - Easily my favorite way to waste large chunks of time. Also available in a free verison.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness&hl=en">Google Fit</a> - They're going to track you everywhere anyway: put it to good use!
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rcp.complete&hl=en">RCP Ringtones</a> - Instantly fell in love with this collection of well-crafted sound effects. There's SO MANY great tones to choose from!
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&hl=en">Google Opinion Rewards</a> - Get asked a few, brief survey questions now and then, earn actual Google Play credit.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk&hl=en">Google Hangouts</a> - I use it exclusively for... everything, now. Pick up the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd?hl=en">companion Chrome app</a> for serious "you're being awesome" points..

##Android - Games
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.berad.wargames&hl=en">WarGames: WOPR</a> - An unexpectedly excellent, unique match-3 game. All movie licenses should be this well done. Terrific soundtrack, too. Offers IAP, but you definitely don't need it.
* <A href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.beholdstudios.knightspp&hl=en">Knights of Pen and Paper</a> - A terrific turn-based RPG with a wonderful sense of humor and retro art style.
