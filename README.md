# Current Tools, Apps and Services I'm Currently Using and Probably Recommend (2014)

*I completely stole this idea from @sammcj.*

## Windows (Development)
* <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> - Still the champ for rapid game development. C# scripted games export to practically everything on the PC, Mac, mobile, and consoles. The enormous online community and educational resources are a huge bonus, too.
* <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Community 2013</a> - The new, improved free version of Visual Studio that also works with Unity... but do that you'll need...
* <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/20b80b8c-659b-45ef-96c1-437828fe7cf2">Visual Studio 2013 Tools for Unity</a> - Kick MonoDevelop to the curb. Once you go VS for Unity, you never go back.
* <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> - Can't imagine working on PHP projects without it.
* <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> - And, of course, if you're working with Java, this is your IDE.
* <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html">Android Studio</a> - Best of all, IntelliJ IDEA is the basis for the now mostly mature official IDE for Android development!
* <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> - An angry bear of a UI, but once you learn how to navigate this insanely great 3D modeling tool, you're in like Flynn.
* <a href="http://www.microridge.com/comtestserial.htm">MicroRidge ComTestSerial</a> - Great terminal client for debugging serial protocols and such. Just works.

## Windows (General)
* <a href="https://obsproject.com/">Open Broadcaster</a> - Your first and last stop for desktop streaming and local video capture.
* <a href="http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/">GifCam</a> - Hands down the best GIF capture tool available. Light, and trivial to use once you figure out the UI.
* <a href="http://quassel-irc.org/">Quassel</a> - Always be on IRC. Even when you're not.
* <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> - I finally broke down and decided to throw my trust behind a password vault. Terrific Windows client.
* <a href="http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/">VirtuaWin</a> - If you're doing the virtual desktop thing, you're doing it with this. At least until Windows 10 comes out, supposedly.
* <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/">Revo Uninstaller</a> - Despite suffering from "scammy looking bloatware" syndrome, lately, the free version (you have to dig for it...) is still a terrific uninstallation tool.


## Android - Non-Games
* <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">CyanogenMod (CM11)</a> - The build for the Galaxy S3 has been surprisingly flawless, so far. Previous third-party ROMs have introduced issues with the camera and GPS, for me. Not so, this time around.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&hl=en">Nova Launcher</a> - Someone recommended this a while back, and I never looked back. It's the first thing that goes on my devices.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alensw.PicFolder&hl=en">QuickPic</a> - A quite decent, free photo gallery app. Especially important now that Android 5 forces the use of the awful Google Plus gallery.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.almalence.opencam&hl=en">A Better Camera</a> - The stock Galaxy S3 camera has a terrific HDR mode. A Better Camera's HDR and DRO modes are excellent replacements, if sometimes buggy.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&hl=en">Google Keep</a> - Finally, a great cloud note taking tool. Lists, text, memos, etc. Grab the excellent <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-notes-and-lis/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki?hl=en">Chrome app</a>, too,  for maximum utility.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digipom.easyvoicerecorder.pro&hl=en">Easy Voice Recorder Pro</a> - Record discreetly to MP3 with various options. Best I've used. Just received a major UI update.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.nickfines.RealCalcPlus&hl=en">RealCalc Plus</a> - My favorite scientific calculator. Also available in a free version. 
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=reddit.news&hl=en">Reddit News Pro</a> - Easily my favorite way to waste large chunks of time. Also available in a free verison.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness&hl=en">Google Fit</a> - They're going to track you everywhere anyway: put it to good use!
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rcp.complete&hl=en">RCP Ringtones</a> - Instantly fell in love with this collection of well-crafted sound effects. There's SO MANY great tones to choose from!
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&hl=en">Google Opinion Rewards</a> - Get asked a few, brief survey questions now and then, earn actual Google Play credit.
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk&hl=en">Google Hangouts</a> - I use it exclusively for... everything, now. Pick up the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd?hl=en">companion Chrome app</a> for serious "you're being awesome" points..

##Android - Games
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.berad.wargames&hl=en">WarGames: WOPR</a> - An unexpectedly excellent, unique match-3 game. All movie licenses should be this well done. Terrific soundtrack, too. Offers IAP, but you definitely don't need it.
* <A href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.beholdstudios.knightspp&hl=en">Knights of Pen and Paper</a> - A terrific turn-based RPG with a wonderful sense of humor and retro art style.

## Websites
* <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> - Premium audio hosting service that finally has a reasonable price tag for subscriptions.
* <a href="http://ezgif.com/optimize">EZGIF.com</a> - Clunky, but workable online tool for optimizing .GIF animations.
* <a href="http://voicebunny.com/">Voice Bunny</a> - Despite all of the issues on their site, technical and practical, if you're a voice actor, it's a nice way to make a quick buck while practicing.
* <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> - Just don't store anything private on it, and you've got yourself a nice, free, 2gb space online with terrific desktop and mobile client access.
